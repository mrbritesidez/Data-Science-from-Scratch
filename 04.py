# Exercises from Chapter 2 - Linear Algebra

# Vectors are objects that can be added together and can be multipled by scalars (numbers) also to form new vectors
# ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
# How are vectors used in the real world to solve real problems?
# Vectors are really more about movement and direction than actual position?
# ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

# ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
# Just vector multiplying a vector as opposed to being multiplied by a scalar?
